[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

Lock-Twitter helps you integrate native Login with Twitter and [Lock](https://auth0.com/lock)

## Usage

## Requierements

iOS 7+

## Install

The Lock-Twitter is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Lock-Twitter", "~> 1.1"
```

## Usage

Twitter authentication use [Reverse Auth](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/ios/using-reverse-auth) to obtain a valid access_token that can be sent to Auth0 Server and validate the user. By default we use iOS Twitter Integration but we support OAuth Web Flow (with Safari) as a fallback mechanism in case the users has no accounts configured in their Apple Device.

First create a new instance of `A0TwitterAuthenticator`

```objc
NSString *twitterApiKey = ... //Remember to obfuscate your api key
NSString *twitterApiSecret = ... //Remember to obfuscate your api secret
A0TwitterAuthenticator *twitter = [A0TwitterAuthenticator newAuthenticationWithKey:twitterApiKey                                                                            andSecret:twitterApiSecret];
```

```swift
let twitterApiKey = ... //Remember to obfuscate your api key
let twitterApiSecret = ... //Remember to obfuscate your api secret
let twitter = A0TwitterAuthenticator.newAuthenticationWithKey(twitterApiKey, andSecret:twitterApiSecret)
```

> We need your twitter app's key & secret in order to sign the reverse auth request. 

and register it with your instance of `A0Lock`

```objc
A0Lock *lock = ... //Get your instance of A0Lock
[lock registerAuthenticators:@[twitter]];
```

```swift
let lock = ... //Get your instance of A0Lock
lock.registerAuthenticators([twitter])
```

##API
